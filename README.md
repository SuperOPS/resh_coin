RESHMAN COIN Mission

Baaahh You Perv Looking at the readme. 

Anyway this mission includes a bunch of stuff from all over the place, I have kept track of where I found what and if I have not I will work on getting it up to par. 

Okay now for the mission. AO needed a cool long term mission and hope fully this will fit the bill properly. I am working on spawning custom compositions for the AOs and such and we will hopefully work on the Counter Insurgent Part of the Insurgeny.
